## Process

### Approach

First, I put myself in the seat of the user and decided what functionality I wanted in the app.
Afterwards, I pseudo-coded the the views, which are found in the client/src file. Then, I created mock-ups of
what the pages should look like. Finally, I began to write the code.

### User Story

This user is someone who enjoys to hike but also enjoys food and a beverage after their hike, on their way home.
He or she will use this app to search for beer within ten miles of their hike.

## Installation

Fork and clone repository. Install dependencies found in both package.json files (in root file and in client file).
